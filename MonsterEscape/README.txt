basically what I did is a game that includes a monster that at first looks peaceful but after clicking the mouse it will transform into a monster, before transforming into a monster there will be followers(class) that keep following him but after transforming the followers will be frightened and will run away heading into the house (which has a fence that will prevent the monster from eating/killing them) the game has three different difficulty level, every level has different quantity of followers, also while increasing the difficulty new power and new characters will appear having different abilities. the program keeps tracking the nearest follower to the monster  

Easy mode:

powers available-'x'.

characters (followers)-Normal black color.

Normal mode:

powers available-'x'-'o'.

characters (followers)-Normal black color - black with sparkling ears.

(sparkling ears followers could only be eaten no power will work on them)

Hard mode:

powers available-'x'-'o'-'t'.

characters (followers)-Normal black color - black with sparkling ears - yellow color.

(yellow colored followers got a high speed which would be hard to kill them)

key instructions:

'a' and 'd' to scroll between the levels given
'ENTER' to confirm the level desired
'arrows' to move the monster
'x' to shoot a laser 
't' to teleport 
'o' to get the follower drunk
'v' to restart the game
